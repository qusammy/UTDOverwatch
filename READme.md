# The UTD Overwatch Club website is under development.
## About
This website is built using HTML and is styled with CSS. It is for the Overwatch Club at UTD, and its intended purpose is to educate individuals interested in joining the club. 

## Tour
Currently, the website has two main files: ``` home.html ``` and ``` model.css ```. ``` home.html ``` is the main front-end page of the website. ``` model.css ```  is the back end, providing necessary styling. The ``` assets ``` folder contains all the images displayed on the website.
