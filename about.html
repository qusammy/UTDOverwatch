            Mission Statement
        </h3>

        <a class = "about-a">
            Welcome to the Overwatch club at UTD. What started out as a small interest group became a strong, 
            developed multitude of people. We are a community of people interested in playing Overwatch both 
            casually and competitively. We welcome all skill levels, introduce scrimmages, and build 
            relationships within the club. We founded this club because of the lack of non-competitive environment 
            for Overwatch at UTD. We would love to have new members join and contribute to our growing population.
