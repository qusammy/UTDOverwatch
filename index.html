<h2>ABOUT US</h2>

<p class = "info">
  Welcome to the UTD Overwatch Club. What started out as a small interest group became a strong, 
  developed multitude of people. We are a community of people interested in playing Overwatch both 
  casually and competitively. We welcome all skill levels, introduce scrimmages, and build 
  relationships within the club. We founded this club because of the lack of non-competitive 
  environment for Overwatch at UTD. We would love to have new members join and contribute to our growing 
  population.
